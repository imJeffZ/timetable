{"id": "ESC204H1S20201", "code": "ESC204H1S", "name": "Praxis III", "description": "Praxis III is the capstone course of the Engineering Science Foundation Design sequence and challenges students to apply the models of engineering design, communication, teamwork, and professionalism introduced and developed in Praxis I and II to the design and testing of a functioning product prototype.The course requires students to integrate the design, technical, and complementary knowledge gained across the Engineering Science Foundation in the context of a single, major, full-term design project.\r\nTeams in Praxis III choose from a curated set of opportunities that integrate technical and complementary considerations. They are responsible both for framing the opportunity and for designing and testing a product prototype that addresses the opportunity. Praxis III culminates in a public showcase where teams present and demonstrate their designs to their stakeholders and to the general public. All courses within the Foundation Design sequence use engineering design to provide a context in which students integrate their knowledge, develop their emerging engineering identity, and codify their individual approach to engineering practice.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Division of Engineering Science", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 200, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "MY 150"}], "size": 204, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [], "size": 72, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0102", "instructors": [], "times": [], "size": 72, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0103", "instructors": [], "times": [], "size": 72, "enrolment": 0}]}
