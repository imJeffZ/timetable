Using engineering tools (especially derived from transport phenomena and chemical kinetics) to model molecular dynamics in living cells and make predictions about cellular behaviour. Specific topics include: receptor-ligand interactions, morphogens, trafficking, signal transduction, cell adhesion and migration, and mechanotransduction. Examples from in vitro tissue culture systems and model organisms in vivo are used.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Division of Engineering Science", "prerequisites": "BME350H1, BME395H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2020 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 43200, "duration": 10800, "location": "MB 78"}, {"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 43200, "duration": 10800, "location": "MB 325"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 64800, "end": 68400, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 2165"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "L0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 2159"}, {"day": "MONDAY", "start": 61200, "end": 64800, "duration": 3600, "location": "HA 401"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 0}]}
