The course will also explore map rendering in the digital and mobile worlds where the power of geography and cartography are leveraged through development of location based services used increasingly in everyday life. Topics covered will include but are not limited to: coordinate systems and map projections, measurement and classification, making maps using GIS, critical appraisal of mapped information. The course will combine lectures with practical sessions where foundational concepts will be applied using GIS and related technologies and software.
