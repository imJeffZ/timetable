We may like to think of ourselves as perfectly free but powerful social forces open up some opportunities and close off others, constraining our freedom and helping to make us what we are. By examining the operation of these social forces, sociology can help us know ourselves. The course is also about skills-building, skills useful not only for success at U of T, but beyond the walls of the university.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Sociology", "prerequisites": "SOC100H1 or SOC102H or SOC103H", "exclusions": "SOC101Y, (SOC102H + SOC103H), SOC200H1, SOC200Y1, SOCB05H3, SOC221H5, SOC200Y5", "level": 100, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Summer S", "breadths": [3], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L5101", "instructors": ["J Harold"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 64800, "end": 75600, "duration": 10800, "location": "MP 134"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 64800, "end": 75600, "duration": 10800, "location": "MP 134"}], "size": 90, "enrolment": 80}]}
