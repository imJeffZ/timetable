How does a society determine which border crossers are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcillegal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and which are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclegal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122? Why are some people deemed \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrefugees\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 while others are not? What consequences do labels like \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdeportee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcimmigrant,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrefugee,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctrafficking victim\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 have on the people who get assigned them? This course will examine these and other similar questions.
