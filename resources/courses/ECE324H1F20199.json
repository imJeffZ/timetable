{"id": "ECE324H1F20199", "code": "ECE324H1F", "name": "Introduction to Machine Intelligence", "description": "This course will provide students with an introduction to machine learning engineering, as a software and engineering discipline. It focuses on the neural network method. Lectures will cover the basic mathematics and intuitions behind neural networks, in particular deep convolutional neural networks, and their application as classifiers and predictions using regression. There will be a focus on conveying known methods to make neural network training succeed. Other topics may include Natural Language Processing basics, recurrent neural networks, transfer learning and generative adversarial networks. There will be\u00a0 reflection on ethics in machine learning. A significant component of the course will be hands-on exposure to a machine-learning software framework, culminating in a design project.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Division of Engineering Science", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 36000, "duration": 3600, "location": "HA 410"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "L0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 39600, "duration": 3600, "location": "MS 2172"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 39600, "duration": 3600, "location": "SS 1069"}, {"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "PB 255"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 0}]}
