{"id": "CHMA11H3Y20195", "code": "CHMA11H3Y", "name": "Introductory Chemistry II: Reactions and Mechanisms", "description": "This course quantitatively examines reactions and equilibria in chemical systems with an emphasis on their thermodynamic properties and chemical kinetics. The course begins with a close examination of solutions followed by dynamic chemical equilibrium. This leads directly to acid/base and solubility equilibria and thermochemistry, including calorimetry. The course concludes with thermodynamics, kinetics and electrochemistry with a strong emphasis on the how these are connected to Gibbs Free Energy. This course includes a three hour laboratory every other week.", "division": "University of Toronto Scarborough", "department": "Dept. of Physical & Environmental Sci (UTSC)", "prerequisites": "CHMA10H3", "exclusions": "CHM110H5, CHM135H1, CHM139H1, CHM151Y1", "level": 100, "campus": "UTSC", "term": "2019 Summer Y", "breadths": [3], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L01", "instructors": ["N Thavarajah"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 57600, "duration": 7200, "location": "SY 110"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 43200, "duration": 7200, "location": "SY 110"}], "size": 192, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0001", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 57600, "duration": 10800, "location": "SW 159"}], "size": 24, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0002", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 57600, "duration": 10800, "location": "SW 159"}], "size": 24, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0003", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 57600, "duration": 10800, "location": "SW 159"}], "size": 24, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0004", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 57600, "duration": 10800, "location": "SW 159"}], "size": 24, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0005", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 57600, "duration": 10800, "location": "SW 153"}], "size": 24, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0006", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 57600, "duration": 10800, "location": "SW 153"}], "size": 24, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0007", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 57600, "duration": 10800, "location": "SW 153"}], "size": 24, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0008", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 57600, "duration": 10800, "location": "SW 153"}], "size": 24, "enrolment": 0}]}
