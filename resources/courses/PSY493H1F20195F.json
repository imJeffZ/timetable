The first objective of the course is to understand how processes in human brains (ranging from the firing of a single neuron to the dynamics of billions) support cognitive abilities (such as recognizing a face, remembering a birthday from childhood, understanding the words in a spoken lecture, or planning a route home from class). The second objective of the course is to understand the methods of contemporary cognitive neuroscience research, to enable students to read primary literature and to understand ongoing debates.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Psychology", "prerequisites": "PSY201H1 (or exclusion), PSY260H1/PSY270H1/PSY290H1/HMB200H1", "exclusions": "PSYC55H3", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Summer F", "breadths": [4], "meeting_sections": []}
